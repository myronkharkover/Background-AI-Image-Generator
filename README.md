# Dall-E-Image-Generator-for-WIply-Platform
Used AWS' lambda functions and api to connect wiply.com's website and platfrom to OpenAi's Dall-E text-to-image model

To run a website that can test the functionality that I built, clone this repo into your preffered venv.

Open a New Terninal and enter 'npm install' to install missing packages

```
% npm install
```

Then start a React App I created to run a webpage on your localhost where you can play with the functionality I created. To start it run the following command in your previously opened terminal after you have installed the necessary packages.

```
% npm start
```

You should be able to experiment and play around with the Dall-E text-to-image model :D
